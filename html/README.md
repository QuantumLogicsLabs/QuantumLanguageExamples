# HTML + CSS examples

500 web pages written as Quantum `.sa` files, 20 in each of 25 topics. Each
page is a complete HTML document with its CSS in a `<style>` element.

A `.sa` file that starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, an HTML comment or an HTML
tag is compiled by Quantum's HTML front-end. It checks the markup the way an
HTML validator does, checks every stylesheet with the CSS front-end, and
prints the document as a browser builds it.

```bash
qrun 10_flexbox/03_justify_content_center.sa        # print the compiled page
qrun --strict 10_flexbox/03_justify_content_center.sa  # any problem is a compile error
qrun --test examples                                # run every example, these included
```

The pages compile with no errors and no warnings. Errors are things like an
unclosed element, misnested tags, a misspelled property, a length with no
unit or a misspelled pseudo-class. A property name that is not close to any
the checker knows is only a warning and is kept, since it may be newer than
the checker's list. The test runner fails a page that has any error.
